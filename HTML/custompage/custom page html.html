    <h1>MORNING RIDE ALONG THE BEACH</h1>
    <p style="color:grey; margin-top: -20px;">By Anton Mauve | 1876 | Oil on Canvas</p>
    <p>Hague School painters were drawn to the harsh existence of poor fishermen, like those living in nearby Scheveningen. Here, however, Mauve depicted the other side of that fishing village: the sunny world of the well-to-do bourgeoisie.</p>

    <p>Three riders descend to the beach, where the bathing cabins stand ready for swimmers. The blond and blue colour scheme effectively conveys the briny atmosphere of a summer day along the seashore.</p>
